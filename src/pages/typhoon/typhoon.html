    <ion-card-content>
      <p>The Philippines is "the most exposed country in the world to tropical storms" according to a Time Magazine article in 2013. In the Philippine languages, typhoons are called bagyo<br>
Typhoons can hit the Philippines any time of year, with the months of June to September being the most active, with August being the most active individual month and May the least active. Typhoons move east to west across the country, heading north was they go. Storms most frequently make landfall on the islands of Eastern Visayas and northern Luzon whereas the southern island and region of Mindanao is largely free of typhoons.<br><br>

<strong>The color of danger: PAGASA’s new rainfall and flood warning system</strong><br>
The colors red, green, and yellow —the same iconic symbols used in streets everywhere— are now given new meaning to alert the public of possible floods.<br><br>

This June, the Philippine Atmospheric Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) started using a color-coded rainfall and flood warning system to help communities prepare for upcoming disasters. <br><br>

Still in its pilot stage, the system is currently being tested in Metro Manila only, according to PAGASA weather specialist Maria Cristina Uson. The agency has yet to determine when to launch it nationwide.<br><br>

In a nutshell, here is the tri-color warning system:<br><br>

<strong>Yellow means “caution”</strong>. Residents are advised to monitor the news for further updates. “Yellow warning” represents 7.5-15 mm rain in an hour which could also cause flooding.<br><br>
 
<strong>Green means “go”</strong>. Go ahead and prepare for possible evacuation. “Green warning” stands for 15-30 mm rain in an hour that is also expected to continue within the next two hours. At this point, low-lying areas are expected to suffer from floods because of relatively heavy downpour. The memorable Typhoon Pedring (Nesat), which hit the country on September 27, 2011, fell within the green warning range as it had a recorded rainfall of about 15-25 mm per hour.<br><br>
 
<strong>Red means “stop”</strong>. Better stop what you are doing now if PAGASA says your area is under a “red warning.” Evacuate. Think about the amount of rain at Typhoon Ondoy’s (Ketsana) peak when it hit the country on September 26, 2009. The recorded rainfall at that time was approximately 56 mm in an hour. According to PAGASA, if more than 30mm rain is observed in an hour, and is expected to continue in the next two hours, then low-lying areas are expected to experience serious flooding. Residents in areas that have low elevation, such as coastal towns and cities, the CAMANAVA (Caloocan, Malabon, Navotas, Valenzuela) area, are advised to evacuate immediately.

   <strong>Public storm signals</strong>
    </ion-card-header>
    <ion-card-content>
      <p>Public storm warning signals (PSWS) given during tropical cyclones should not be mistaken for rainfall and flood warnings.<br><br>

The various PSWS levels are: <br><br>

<strong>Public Storm Warning Signal #1</strong>. This means that strong winds of up to 60 kph are expected within 36 hours. Because of the long lead time, it’s common for people to think that the weather forecast is wrong. Damage is evident mostly on rice crops, light-weighed structures —nipa huts and cogon huts— and banana plants. Coastal communities are expected to be prepared for possible evacuation at any time. At this PSWS level, preschool classes within affected areas are automatically suspended.<br><br>
 
<strong> Storm Warning Signal #2</strong>.  At this level, kids from preschool to high school “celebrate” because of class suspension. Within 24 hours, winds of 60 to 100 kph are expected. Not just crops but also galvanized roofs may be damaged from such winds. Travel by water, especially by boat and other small seacraft, should be avoided.
 
<strong>Public Storm Warning Signal #3</strong>. Most offices and all schools up to colleges and universities are closed because it is dangerous for anyone to travel. Very strong winds of 100 to 185 kph are expected within 18 hours. Aside from the damages mentioned in the previous PSWS numbers, electricity and water supply may also be affected. Air and sea travel are both risky at this point. Classes in all levels are suspended. Communities affected should expect major damage to crops and property.<br><br>
 
At this point, communities should be wary of the “eye” of the storm. Winds are at their strongest nearest the eye, but die down to fair weather for about two hours as the eye passes over. After this, the storm resurges, bringing strong winds in the opposite direction.<br><br>
 
<strong>Public Storm Warning Signal #4</strong>. Winds with speed of over 185 kph are expected to hit the area within 12 hours. Residential, agricultural, and industrial properties may be severely damaged. Electricity and communication may also be disrupted. Residents along coastal areas and other danger zones are advised to evacuate as soon as possible.<br><br>

<strong>Before a Typhoon</strong><br>
•	Locate a safe room or the safest areas of your home or for each typhoon hazard. The safest areas may not actually be your home, but within your community.<br>
•	Discuss the type of hazards that could affect your family and know your home's vulnerability to storm surge, flooding, and wind.<br>
•	Stock non-perishable food supplies, a first-aid kit, a battery-powered radio, flashlights, and extra batteries in air-tight containers.<br>
•	Adjust refrigerator temperatures to the coldest settings to reduce the potential for food spoiling if the power is temporarily lost.<br>
•	Have a non-electric analog telephone or a fully-charged cell phone available in case you need to make an emergency call during a power outage.<br>
•	Take the advice of local authorities. Evacuate if ordered.<br>
•	If an evacuation is necessary, unplug all appliances, TV's and computers before leaving your home.<br>
•	Remove fuses from the air conditioning system to prevent damage.<br>
•	Turn off water to prevent flooding from broken pipes.<br>
•	Turn off gas to prevent leaks from occurring.<br>
•	Determine escape routes from your home and a nearby place to meet with loved ones. These should be measured in tens of miles when possible.<br><br>


<strong>Necessary Precautions</strong><br>
•	If you have a shed, make sure its doors are closed tightly: otherwise, they could end up blowing off their hinges and becoming dangerous projectiles.<br>
•	Bring in flags, awnings and house ornaments, such as wreaths, wind chimes, or sculptures.<br>
•	Bring plants in pots into the garage. These could also become dangerous projectiles.<br>
•	Don't leave cars parked under trees, especially if you may be in the car when the storm strikes!<br>
•	Check pool covers to ensure that they are secure.<br>
•	Be alert for tornadoes.<br>
•	Be cautious with storm surge flooding. These high waves can be more deadly than hurricane winds. Leave the coast and stay away from low-lying areas.<br>
•	Do not use candles during the storm - they could cause a fire. Stick with battery operated flashlights.<br><br>
<strong>During a typhoon</strong><br>
If you are staying home, here's what you should do:<br>
•	Monitor the radio or television for weather conditions and updates.<br>
•	Do not go outside, even if the storm appears to have subsided. The calm or the "eye" of the storm can pass quickly, leaving you outside when strong winds resume.<br>
•	Stay away from all windows and exterior doors, and seek shelter in a bathroom or basement. Bathtubs can provide some shelter if you cover yourself with plywood or other materials.<br>
•	Evacuate to a shelter or a neighbor's home if your home is damaged, or if you are instructed to do so by emergency personnel.<br>
•	If power is lost, turn off all major appliances to reduce the chances of damaging a power surge.<br>
•	Do not handle electrical equipment and do not use the telephone except in an emergency.<br><br>
Regardless of whether you stay or leave, it is important to unplug appliances and electronics, and remove air conditioner fuses to avoid damage caused by power surges when lines and power are restored.<br><br>
<strong>What to do after a typhoon</strong><br>
The storm has passed. What now?<br>
•	When power returns to your home, do not start all major appliances at once. Turn them on gradually to reduce damage to sensitive equipment.<br>
•	Avoid downed, damaged or loose power lines and report them immediately to the local police and fire department, as well as to the local transmission and distribution services provider in your area.<br>
•	Even if you have ventilation, never use a generator indoors. This includes garages, basements and crawlspaces. Exhaust fumes contain high levels of carbon monoxide which can be deadly if inhaled. Even when left outside, keep generators away from doors and windows and at least 10 feet away from your home. Also, allow your generator to cool off before refilling it with gas – splashing gas on hot generator components can lead to a fire.<br>
•	Do not use electrical or gas appliances that have been wet, and do not turn on damaged appliances because of the hazards of electric shock or fire.<br>
•	Never use charcoal indoors because burning charcoal produces high levels of carbon monoxide that can reach lethal levels in enclosed spaces<br><br>


<strong>When There Is No typhoon: Make a typhoon Plan</strong><br>
•	Know your  typhoon risk. Talk to your local emergency management agency.<br>
•	Make an emergency plan.<br>
•	Build or restock your basic disaster supplies kit, including food and water, a flashlight, batteries, chargers, cash, and first aid supplies.<br>
•	Consider buying flood insurance.<br>
•	Familiarize yourself with local emergency plans. Know where to go and how to get there should you need to get to higher ground or to evacuate.<br>
•	Stay tuned to local wireless emergency alerts, TV, or radio for weather updates, emergency instructions, or evacuation orders.
