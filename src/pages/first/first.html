      <strong>For All Burns</strong>
    </ion-card-header>
    <ion-card-content>
      <p>
<strong>1. Stop Burning Immediately</strong><br>
•	Put out fire or stop the person's contact with hot liquid, steam, or other material.<br>
•	Help the person "stop, drop, and roll" to smother flames.<br>
•	Remove smoldering material from the person.<br>
•	Remove hot or burned clothing. If clothing sticks to skin, cut or tear around it.<br><br>
<strong>2. Remove Constrictive Clothing Immediately</strong><br>
•	Take off jewelry, belts, and tight clothing. Burns can swell quickly.<br><br>
Then take the following steps:<br>
<strong>For First-Degree Burns (Affecting Top Layer of Skin)</strong><br>
<strong>1. Cool Burn</strong><br>
•	Hold burned skin under cool (not cold) running water or immerse in cool water until pain subsides.<br>
•	Use compresses if running water isn’t available.<br><br>
<strong>2. Protect Burn</strong><br>
•	Cover with sterile, non-adhesive bandage or clean cloth.<br>
•	Do not apply butter or ointments, which can cause infection.<br><br>
<strong>3. Treat Pain</strong><br>
•	Give over-the-counter pain reliever such as ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin),acetaminophen (Tylenol), or naproxen (Aleve).<br><br>
<strong>4. When to See a Doctor</strong><br>
Seek medical help if:<br>
•	You see signs of infection, like increased pain, redness, swelling, fever, or oozing.<br>
•	The person needs tetanus or booster shot, depending on date of last injection. Tetanus booster should be given every 10 years.<br>
•	Redness and pain last more than a few hours.<br>
•	Pain worsens.<br><br>
<strong>5. Follow Up</strong><br>
•	The doctor will examine the burn and may prescribe antibiotics and pain medication.<br><br>
For Second-Degree Burns (Affecting Top 2 Layers of Skin)<br>
<strong>1. Cool Burn</strong><br>
•	Immerse in cool water for 10 or 15 minutes.<br>
•	Use compresses if running water isn’t available.<br>
•	Don’t apply ice. It can lower body temperature and cause further damage.<br>
•	Don’t break blisters or apply butter or ointments, which can cause infection.<br><br>
<strong>2. Protect Burn</strong><br>
•	Cover loosely with sterile, nonstick bandage and secure in place with gauze or tape.<br>
<strong>3. Prevent Shock</strong><br>
Unless the person has a head, neck, or leg injury, or it would cause discomfort:<br>
•	Lay the person flat.<br>
•	Elevate feet about 12 inches.<br>
•	Elevate burn area above heart level, if possible.<br>
•	Cover the person with coat or blanket.<br><br>
<strong>4. See a Doctor</strong><br>
•	The doctor can test burn severity, prescribe antibiotics and pain medications, and administer a tetanus shot, if needed.<br>

<strong>Hurricane First Aid</strong>
    </ion-card-header>
    <ion-card-content>
      <p><strong>1. Invest in a First Aid Kit</strong><br>
You can buy a kit, or assemble one of your own. The Red Cross provides a great list of what a first aid kit should include for a family of four.<br>
In addition, prepare a list of your doctors’ names and phone numbers, the dosage and frequency for all prescription and over-the-counter medications, and emergency contacts. To prepare for possible evacuation, make sure you have a solid supply of prescription medications on hand for anyone in the family who needs them.<br><br>
<strong>2. Get CPR Certified</strong><br>
Everyone, but especially parents, should get CPR certified. If someone has drowned or is unconscious and not breathing, it’s important to perform CPR right away — particularly in the event of drowning. The most important point is to start quickly. Remember that CPR no longer requires mouth-to-mouth resuscitation. When in doubt, start chest compressions quickly.<br><br>
<strong>3. Learn How to Treat Heavily Bleeding Wounds</strong><br>
Here’s what to do in the event someone is bleeding heavily:<br>
•	Apply firm pressure on the wound using a sterile cloth. Keep the cloths in place using a bandage or gauze. If blood seeps through, don’t remove the material, but continue to apply pressure. You want clotting to occur.<br>
•	If the cut can be raised above heart level, this may help slow the bleeding.<br>
•	If there is a foreign object embedded in the wound, do not remove it; apply padding around it and continue to hold pressure.<br>
•	If a finger or other appendage is amputated, place it in a clean bag and then into cold water or ice.<br><br>
<strong>4. Prepare to Deal with Burns or Lightning Strikes</strong><br>
If someone has been struck by lightning and is unresponsive, check for spontaneous breathing and a pulse, and begin CPR if you don’t detect them. Don’t worry — you won’t be electrocuted.<br>
In case of a burn from any cause, unless clothing is burned to the skin, remove jewelry or restrictive clothing near the wound to prevent constriction. Cool the affected area with cool running water or a cold compress. Be careful around open bodies of water if the burn was caused by electrical currents, including lightning.<br><br>
<strong>5. Know How to Stabilize a Broken Bone</strong><br>
If a head, neck, or back injury is suspected, do not move the victim. Call 911 right away. For extremity injuries, attempt to keep the injured limb stable and free from movement. Apply ice if you have it. Prepare a temporary splint using common items such as thin boards, newspapers, magazines, or cardboard. Wrap with a bandage or tape until you can get to emergency care.<br><br>
<strong>6. Use RICE for Strains or Sprains</strong><br>
In the case of a strain or sprain — always remember R.I.C.E!<br>
•	Rest and do not put weight on the sprain or strain.<br>
•	Ice the injury to keep swelling down. Use a barrier, such as a shirt or cloth, between ice and skin to prevent cold-related skin injuries<br>
•	Compress — apply compression to help control swelling. An ACE wrap works great.<br>
•	Elevate the injured extremity above the heart.<br>
Finally, be sure to follow official instructions when a hurricane or other weather disaster is happening. Do not put yourself in jeopardy to rescue another person.<br>
In the case of a natural or man-made disaster where there are limited medical resources, there will probably be some sort of triaging system to determine priority based on the severity of a person’s injury. In this situation, try to be mindful and patient. Smaller injuries, such as broken bones or minor bleeding, might not be as urgent as those of drowning victims or someone suffering a heart attack. In the case of an emergency, do what you can to remain calm, and only call 911 if it’s a true emergency.<br>
Remember, these tips for hurricane preparedness should not replace professional medical advice, or be considered or used as a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment from a healthcare provider. You should always speak to a doctor, and call your doctor or 911 immediately after an event when there are injuries.<br>

<strong>First Aid if there’s an earthquake</strong>
    </ion-card-header>
    <ion-card-content>
      <p>
        
        First-aid is timely, proper care that is given until more advanced personnel arrive. First, calm yourself by breathing deeply. Then, proceed as follows:<br>
1.	Check the scene. Is it safe for you to enter? Monitor the situation from a safe distance.<br>
2.	Check the victim for life-threatening conditions. Check for, breathing, other signs of life, and for visible signs of injury. Do not move the victim unless you are in a hazardous environment that warrants such a risk.<br>
3.	Perform first-aid. Follow the instructions of Campus Safety. First-aid should be performed if medical personnel are not immediately available. Perform the instructions under the first-aid section of this pamphlet. Keep the victim comfortable until help arrives. Protect yourself and the victim(s). Again, it is not recommended to move or transport the victim(s) unless the local environment is unsafe.<br><br>
<strong>FAINTING, UNCONSCIOUSNESS, AND SHOCK</strong><br>
Have the victim lie or sit down and rest. Keep the victim comfortable, not hot or cold, until help arrives. Ask or look for a medical emergency I.D. Treat other injuries as necessary.<br><br>
<strong>HEART ATTACK</strong><br>
Call 911 immediately. If the victim is conscious, help them find a comfortable position. Closely monitor pulse and breathing. If there are no signs of life (movement, nonresponsive) perform CPR, if trained. Keep victim comfortable, not hot or cold, until help arrives. Ask for or look for a medical emergency I.D.<br><br>
<strong>SEVERE BLEEDING AND WOUNDS</strong><br>
Apply direct pressure on the wound. Use a clean cloth or hand. Add more cloths if blood soaks through. Keep pressure on wound until help arrives. CAUTION: Communicable diseases may be transmitted by exchange of body fluids. Be sure to use protective gloves and other equipment as available.<br><br>
<strong>FRACTURES AND SPRAINS</strong><br>
Keep victim still. Keep injured area immobile. Apply ice to the injured area, if available. 
CAUTION: Any victims suspected of having head, neck, or back injuries should be kept absolutely still. Treat for shock as necessary.<br><br>
<strong>INTERNAL BLEEDING</strong><br>
If the victim is coughing or vomiting up blood or “coffee ground” material, they may have internal bleeding. Call 911 immediately. Do not let the victim ingest any liquids or solids. Help the victim into a comfortable position and try to keep the victim calm.<br><br>
<strong>SEIZURES</strong><br>
During the seizure, allow the seizure run its course. Help the victim lie down to avoid injury. Loosen restrictive clothing. Do not try to restrain a seizure victim. After the seizure, check to see if the victim is breathing, if he/she is not, give CPR and send for AED. Check to see if the victim is wearing a medical emergency alert or similar communication of medical emergency condition. Check to see if the victim has any burns around the mouth, this might indicate poison. Stay with the victim. Call Campus Safety (909) 607-2000, or x72000 immediately. The victim of a seizure or convulsion may be conscious but not talkative when the intense movement stops. Be certain that breathing continues. When the victim seems stable, get help.<br><br>
<strong>BURNS: THERMAL AND CHEMICAL</strong><br>
Immerse burned area in cool water. Flood chemical burn with cool water for at least 15 minutes, away from eyes an uninjured tissue. Cover burn with dry bandage. Keep the victim comfortable.<br><br>
<strong>CHOKING</strong><br>
If the victim is able to speak or cough effectively, DO NOT interfere with their attempt to expel the foreign object. If breathing stops, or coughing becomes weak and ineffective, use abdominal thrusts (Heimlich Maneuver) to expel the object If choking victim is on floor, use CPR compressions, then try to breathe into the victim. Repeat until air goes in. Repeat until air goes in. Call 911 immediately.<br><br>
<strong>ELECTRIC SHOCK</strong><br>
Do not touch the person who has been in contact with electrical current until you are certain that the electricity has been turned off. This must be done at the plug, circuit breaker or fuse box. If the victim is in contact with a wire or a downed power line, use a dry stick to move it away. Check for breathing. If the victim shows no sign of life (nonresponsive, not breathing), start CPR immediately, and send for AED. Call for help. While you are waiting for help to arrive, keep the victim comfortable. Do not give the victim anything to eat or drink until she/he has seen a doctor. Give the victim assurance that help is on the way.<br><br>
<strong>DRUG OVERDOSE / ALCOHOL POISONING</strong><br>
Call for help immediately. Check the victims breathing and pulse. If breathing has stopped, perform CPR, send for AED. CAUTION: Revived victims of alcohol poisoning can be violent both towards themselves and others. While waiting for help, watch for breathing, turn the victim on his/her side to prevent vomiting and choking, and keep victim comfortable. Do not throw water in the victim’s face or give liquor or stimulants. Do not leave the victim unattended.
REMEMBER: Alcohol in combination with other drugs can be deadly.<br><br>
<strong>HEAD INJURIES</strong><br>
If there is bleeding from an ear, it may mean there is a skull fracture. Special care must be taken when trying to stop any scalp bleeding when it is suspected a skull fracture exists. Bleeding from the scalp can be very heavy even when the injury is not serious. Do not press too hard. Be extremely careful when applying pressure over the wound so that bone chips from a possible fracture will not be pressed into the brain. Do not bend the victim’s neck as it may be fractured. Call for help. Let a professional medical person clean the wound or stitch it if necessary. Do not give the victim any food or liquid. It may mask important symptoms. Do not move the victim unless it is dangerous to remain at that location.

      <p>
        
        <strong>First Aid Tips</strong><br>
* Learn first aid to help deal with emergency situations such as floods.<br>
* Ensure you have a first aid kit in your house and car, and that its contents are up-to-date.<br>
* Know the DRSABCD action plan for the management of an unconscious casualty (including drowning) to protect yourself and others:<br>
<strong>Danger</strong> – ensure the area is safe for yourself, others and the casualty.<br>
<strong>Response</strong>– check for a response.<br>
Send for help – call 911.<br>
<strong>Airway</strong> – make sure the airway is clear and open.<br>
<strong>Breathing</strong> – check for breathing and response.<br><br>
<strong>Mental or Physical Aid?</strong><br>
First Aid during a disaster would comprise of physical and mental aid to be rendered to the sufferers. Sometimes the physical suffering encountered by the victims may be less vis-à-vis that of the mental agony. The mental agony may further lead to cases where the population goes into depression. Apart from the physical assistance in helping the affected to overcome the injury, first aid during emergency should have quality counseling and support services as well.<br>
The first aid immediately after a disaster may consist of the following-<br>
(1) Attending to the individuals who have broken limbs, bones and apply local massage therapy only if the aid provider is well-trained on the same.<br>
(2) Disinfecting the body parts/areas where there has been minor bruises with antiseptic and then plastering those areas with bandage<br>
(3) Attending the parts having burns with utmost caution so as to avoid bringing those areas in close contact with water<br>
(4) Putting in place a working communication system, even if there has been a complete breakdown of the same<br>
(5) Attending to the patients on a priority basis depending upon the suffering an individual is going through<br>
(6) Counseling the sufferers with minor ailments and increasing their motivational level so that they can join hands with the relief and rescue operators.<br>
(7) Ensure that a chaotic situation is prevented where too many cooks spoils the broth.<br>
(8) Posses the information database regarding the primary health care centers, hospitals, international and local non governmental bodies, apart from the civil defense departments of different areas, which in turn would reduce the response time, immediately after a disaster.<br>
(9) Prevent the spread of contaminated food and drinking water by ensuring the hygienic distribution procedures.<br>
(10)Focus on personal hygiene of each and every patient impacted by the disaster, which in turn would reduce the chances of an epidemic, borne out of the tragedy<br>
(11)Provide post-accident SOS support services to all the affected individuals, which in turn would reduce the mortality rate of the sufferers.<br>
(12)Personal ability to withstand an environment full of cries and chaos prevailing immediately after a disaster is an absolute must.<br>
