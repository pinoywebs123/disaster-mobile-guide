      <p>This explains what actions to take when you receive a flood watch or warning alert from the National Weather Service for your local area and what to do before, during, and after a flood.<br><br>
        <strong>Basic Safety Tips</strong><br>
•	Turn Around, Don’t Drown! <br>
•	Avoid walking or driving through flood waters.<br>
•	Just 6 inches of moving water can knock you down, and 1 foot of water can sweep your vehicle away.<br>
•	If there is a chance of flash flooding, move immediately to higher ground. <br>
•	If floodwaters rise around your car but the water is not moving, abandon the car and move to higher ground. Do not leave the car and enter moving water.<br>
•	Avoid camping or parking along streams, rivers, and creeks during heavy rainfall. These areas can flood quickly and with little warning.<br><br>
<strong>Before flood</strong><br>

<strong>Flood Watch = “Be Aware.”</strong> Conditions are right for flooding to occur in your area.<br><br>

<strong>Steps to Take</strong><br>
•	Turn on your TV/radio. You will receive the latest weather updates and emergency instructions.<br>
•	Know where to go. You may need to reach higher ground quickly and on foot.<br>
•	Build or restock your emergency preparedness kit. Include a flashlight, batteries, cash, and first aid supplies.<br><br>
<strong>Prepare Your Home</strong><br>
•	Bring in outdoor furniture and move important indoor items to the highest possible floor. This will help protect them from flood damage.<br>
•	Disconnect electrical appliances and do not touch electrical equipment if you are wet or standing in water. You could be electrocuted.<br>
•	If instructed, turn off your gas and electricity at the main switch or valve. This helps prevent fires and explosions.<br><br>

•	Return home only when authorities say it is safe.<br>
•	Be aware of areas where floodwaters have receded and watch out for debris. Floodwaters often erode roads and walkways.<br>
•	Do not attempt to drive through areas that are still flooded.<br>
•	Avoid standing water as it may be electrically charged from underground or downed power lines.<br>
•	Photograph damage to your property for insurance purposes.<br><br>
